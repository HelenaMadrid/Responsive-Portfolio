        <p>Hi! My name is Helena Madrid, I'm 27 years old and I'm from Monterrey.</p>
        <p>I have an undergraduate degree in Hispanic Literature from Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. Right after graduation I started working in New York City for an award-winning travel website called <a href="www.fathomaway.com">Fathom</a>. Needlessly to say, I had one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Starting from scratch, meeting amazing people, and having a good and interesting job, it was a dream.</p>
        <p>But now I am back in Monterrey and ready for a new adventure: working for a company that creates new bussineses based on the internet. As this is a completely new field for me so I am taking this bootcamp to better understand the business I'm now in.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: I have more pictures of my dogs in my phone than anything else.</p>
